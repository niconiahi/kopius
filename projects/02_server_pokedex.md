# Server pokedex

## Knowledge

This application will introduce how, normally, a React client application interacts with a server, including:

- How the `Request` and `Response` model fits into a React's metaframework
- How to send data from the client and how to receive such data from the server, using the native [form element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form)
- How to _load data_ in the server [loader](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/data-loading) and hand it off to your client
- How to _recieve data_ in the server [action](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/actions) and store it

## By the end of this project

- Expect to understand the communication between your _client_'s React application with your _server_'s metaframework function
- Expect to understand exactly how the `form` element works
- You will have the same the functionality as [01_pokedex](./01_pokedex.md) but without any `useState` or `useEffect`, that is, no Javascript on the client
- You will understand what we are talking when talking about _bundle size_ and good pratices around it

## Description

- It will list pokemons showing their name, types and image
- The application will have two sections: the "uncatched" pokemons and the pokedex
- This application will allow adding, one of the "uncatched" pokemons, to the pokedex
- It will allow removing the added pokemon from the pokedex
- It will allow filtering the list of pokemons by name and pokemon type
- It will "remember" the pokemons that were added to the pokedex when refreshing the page
