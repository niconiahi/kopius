- React's template engine called [jsx](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
- React's foundational concept called [rendering](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit), required for being able to follow the code flow
- [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) model, through the usage of [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
- Schema validation understanding and usage
- What _data persistance_ is and how to use it?
