This will hold all the documentation given for the React course

## Methodology

- Learn by example
- Do not omit steps, do not leave for later
- Write the code yourself
- Ask the AI for explanations, plan with it. Do not ask for the final code to copy paste. You can ask to make you an explanatory example about what's explaning. It's usually a good idea, so that it's not only words
