### Normal states

```jsx
const [name, setName] = useState("Ana")
```

### Derived states

I get the value for this state using previously declared variables

```jsx
const [name, setName] = useState("Ana")
const surname = "Gonzalez"
const fullName = `${name} ${surname}`
```

### Functions out of components

We'll maintain funcitons outside of components in order to have clean and simple components

If we leave the function's declarations inside the component, it gets too big too fast

### TODO

- Do example using `type` to work with a switch statement
